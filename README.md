# Welcome to my blog!

Live hosted here: [Code Shenanigans Blog](https://www.callshenanigans.com/)

This Github project may be used as an example of how to setup your own blog with Jekyll. All I ask is that you don't plagiarize the content of my blog and you reference my work if you use it. Content and feature updates will arrive never late, nor early, but precisely when I mean for them to.

# Commands

To serve locally for testing purposes:
``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To update:
``` bash
bundle exec update
```
