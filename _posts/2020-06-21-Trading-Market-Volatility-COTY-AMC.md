Ordinarily I would be writing about something technical of sorts, but a hobby of mine is investing and I thought I would reference a recent trade. Perhaps this post foreshadows an eventual intersect between my investing and coding/algorithms hobbies. Algorithms play an enormous part in identifying various types of trades (value, short squeeze, momentum, etc.). This post however, I did my homework manually.

Recently, I have been scouting for companies that have been on a downward trend prior to and throughout the pandemic. The theory is that when the pandemic eases, these companies, regardless of their fundamentals, will stage epic comebacks in anticipation of returning to profitability. In a sense, this is a Contrarian strategy, because we are targeting stocks with high short interest that could lead to a [short squeeze](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp). The two companies I have selected are AMC Entertainment and COTY.

[AMC Entertainment](http://www.investor.amctheatres.com/) is a beaten down national movie theater chain whose share price has declined over 80% in the last 5 years. [COTY](https://investors.coty.com/home/default.aspx) is the parent company of major beauty and luxury brands such as Covergirl, Burberry, Calvin Klein, and more. The pandemic forced them to cut their dividend extending their 5-year share price decline to over 80% as well.

Both stocks appear to be under a lot of pressure, and any bit of good news pertaining to a return to profitability could set off a short squeeze. The trade I selected here is to buy shares and sell out of the money covered calls. The fee from the covered call grants downside protection, in both trades near 20%, while still allowing for substantial upside over the next several months. Here is a summary of the trade:

| Open Date | Ticker | Cost Basis | Call Strike Price | Call Expiry Date | Call Fee Collected | Potential Upside | Downside Protection |
| :-------: | :----: | :--------: | :---------------: | :--------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------: |
| 06-19-2020 | [COTY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COTY/) | $4.76 | $7.00 | 1-15-2021 | $1.00 | 68% | -21% |
| 06-19-2020 | [AMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/) | $5.55 | $7.00 | 12-18-2020 | $1.00 | 44% | -18% |


You can see that even substantially out of the money calls are selling at quite the premium, [implying high volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp). Given the month difference in strike date, the trades have very similar trends. The last ingredient is to set a [Stop Loss and Trailing Stop](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trailing-stop-loss.asp) of 25% and 20% on each trade. The trailing stop means if at any point the share price drops below 80% of its peak it will close the calls and sell the shares at market value. The initial stop loss of 75% leaves a wider risk tolerance at the opening of the trade to mitigate the likelihood of the trade being close by [whipsawing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whipsaw.asp). Once the trade is positive the trailing stop will take over.

In conclusion, both these trades appear to be falling knives, but the high premium on sold calls mitigates quite a bit of potential loss. If these are in fact under pressure, any bit of good news could lead to an epic short squeeze. Here's to hoping!
