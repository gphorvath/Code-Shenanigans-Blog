Ordinarily I would be writing about something technical of sorts, but a hobby of mine is investing and I thought I would reference a recent trade. 

Recently, I have been scouting for companies that have been on a downward trend prior to and throughout the pandemic. The theory is that when the pandemic eases, these companies, regardless of their fundamentals, will stage epic comebacks in anticipation of returning to profitability. The two companies I have selected are AMC Entertainment and COTY.

AMC Entertainment is a beaten down national movie theater chain whose share price has declined over 80% in the last 5 years. 

COTY is the parent company of major beauty and luxury brands such as Covergirl, Burberry, Calvin Klein, and more. The pandemic forced them to cut their dividend extending their 5-year share price decline to over 80% as well.

Both stocks appear to be under a lot of pressure, and any bit of good news pertaining to a return to profitability could set off a short squeeze. The trade I selected here is to buy shares and sell out of the money covered calls. The fee from the covered call grants downside protection, in both trades near 20%, while still allowing for substantial upside over the next several months. Here is a summary of the trade:

| Open Date | Ticker | Cost Basis | Call Strike Price | Call Expiry Date | Call Fee Collected | Potential Upside | Downside Protection |
| :-------: | :----: | :--------: | :---------------: | :--------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------: |
| 06-19-2020 | [COTY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COTY/) | $4.76 | $7.00 | 1-15-2021 | $1.00 | 68% | -21% |
| 06-19-2020 | [AMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/) | $5.55 | $7.00 | 12-18-2020 | $1.00 | 44% | -18% |


You can see that even substantially out of the money calls are selling at quite the premium, implying high potential upsides. Given the month difference in strike date, the trades have very similar trends. The last ingredient is to set a Trailing Market Stop Loss of 25% on each trade. That means if at any point the share price drops below 75% of its peak it will close the calls and sell the shares at market value. 

In conclusion, both these trades appear to be falling knives, but the high premium on sold calls mitigates quite a bit of potential loss. If these are in fact under pressure, any bit of good news could lead to an epic short squeeze. Here's to hoping!
