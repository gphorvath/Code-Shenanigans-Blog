Welcome all to my new blog. It took time to overcome my apprehension and post this, but I quote one of my favorite books:  
> **It’s the job that’s never started as takes longest to finish...**  
>  _Sam Gamgee. The Fellowship of the Ring. Book Two. VII. The Mirror of Galadriel._  

This blog will begin unstructured to allow me to post thoughts of a variety of topics. Most of the thoughts will be related to software development projects I am working on. Expect much code, machine learning, and shenanigans.
