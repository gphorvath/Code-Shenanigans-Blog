<h1>Welcome to Code Shenanigans Blog!</h1>

<p class="view">by Gregory Horvath</p>

<p>Welcome all to my new blog. It took time to overcome my apprehension and post this, but I quote one of my favorite novels:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It’s the job that’s never started as takes longest to finish…</strong><br />
 <em>Sam Gamgee. The Fellowship of the Ring. Book Two. VII. The Mirror of Galadriel.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This blog will begin unstructured to allow me to post thoughts of a variety of topics. Most of the thoughts will be related to software development projects I am working on. Expect much code, machine learning, and shenanigans.</p>
