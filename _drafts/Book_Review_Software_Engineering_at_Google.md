Review of [Software Engineering at Google](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming-ebook/dp/B0859PF5HB/)

This book is split into three major sections, Culture, Processes, and Tools.

Software engineering is defined in terms of programmings as, "software engineering is programming integrated overtime". More specifically software engineering differs from programming in time, scale, and certain trade-offs. In a sense programming is about producing code to achieve some objective. As long as that code won't become an integral part of some complex system with a long life-space, this might be sufficient. The practice of software engineering is required for code that must be maintained, scaled, and integrated, for the duration of its useful life span.

Culture:
Debunking the genius myth - Linus Torvalds didn't create Linux alone. Few people are capable of achieve success at scale alone.

Bus Factor: the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your project is completely doomed.

Many eyes make all bugs shallow

Pillars of social interaction: humility, respect, trust. Google expands upon these... "Thrive in ambiguity", "Values feedback", "challenges status quo", "puts the user first", "cares about the team", "does the right thing"

Fail fast and iterate - if you aren't failing you aren't taking enough risks or being innovative.


[Blameless Post Mortem](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/) - turn failures into learning experiences by evaluating the situation without apologies, excuses, and finger-pointing.
