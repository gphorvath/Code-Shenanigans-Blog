# Overview
First of all, the purpose of this post is not to sell you snake oil, convince you to click on a referral link, or donate money to my coffee fund - although I never say no to coffee. Rather, the purpose of this post is to show others who may be setting up their own blog or attracting a lot of attention on Github, to leverage the Content Creator program for the Brave browser to take in tips.

There are a zillion ways to take in tips for your work, why choose Brave's Content Creation program?
1. It's super easy to setup and integrates with you personal blog, YouTube, Github, and more.
2. You can receive donations in Crypto (for those Crypto currency fans out there)
3. The donation scheme is natively integrated with the Brave browser to it easy for a passerby to donate.
4. Brave browser pays users a small amount of crypto for permission to serve them advertisements - so they even have free resources to spend on you!
