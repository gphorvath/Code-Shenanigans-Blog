This is the first post in a series about setting up and experimenting with various Machine Learning tools. To begin, I am going to give a little insight into my dev environment to help others following this work. My dev environment is as follows:
* Windows 10
* Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Docker Desktop running WSL2 engine
* VS Code using Docker plugin

The hardest part of setting this up was getting Docker running with WSL2. To help I used this [blog post](https://medium.com/@XanderGrzy/docker-in-windows-wsl-2-bc62b5236d1c).
